# mcuIOTHomeElementsSensor
IOT home elements sensor code runs on a ESP8266 or similar MCU based module which is placed outside your home and powered by a 5v1A source. This sensor reports its data to a Nodejs server running on a "Raspberry Pi 4b". This module supports data from a DHT11/DHT22, temperature and humidity sensor and any analog or digital rain sensor.
